My work is primarily web-oriented, but my background in Graphic Design enables me to operate across the physical-virtual chasm and making those cross-media connections is often an important component of my work. While the modern world becomes increasingly more electronic, the visceral human desire for touch and physicality remains. Communication that conciously addresses that desire has great potential for touching us very significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n\r\n\r\n__MFA, Web Design & New Media__,  \r\nAcademy of Arts University, San Francisco  \r\nSpring 2010—Fall 2011 ( *2 of 3 year program, left prior to thesis* ) \r\n\r\n__BA, Graphic Design & Multimedia Arts__,  \r\nLewis & Clark College  \r\nFall 2003—Spring 2007 \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Skills\r\n_(In Order of  Famiiarity/Fluency)_\r\n#####Conceptual, Graphic and Web Design & Development:\r\n+ Visual Design Fundamentals:\r\n  + Typography  \r\n  + Layout & Composition\r\n  + Color, Value & Color Theory\r\n+ User-Centric Design Mehods \r\n  + User Experience Design & Testing\r\n  + Interaction Design\r\n  + Interface Design\r\n  + Best Practices, Documentation & Testing\r\n+ Front-End Code & Development  \r\n  + HTML5 + CSS3 + JS/JQuery\r\n  + LESS(CSS)    \r\n  \r\n####Software\r\n+ Adobe Creative Suite 6:  \r\n  + Photoshop   \r\n  + Illustrator  \r\n  + InDesign  \r\n  + After Effects\r\n  \r\n***\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n\r\n####Ely Kahn Creative Design (Independent), San Francisco, CA\r\n    \r\n__Web & Graphic Designer - 2010 to Present__  \r\nAs an Indie Web Designer in San Francisco, there are an unfathomable number of opportunities paired with an equally inconcievable number of skilled competitors. My broad skill-set allows me to take on and execute comprehensive campaigns that involve branding & identity, graphic design, web design and development and tie it all together as a holistic User Experience and Social Media strategy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Progressive Democrats of America, East Bay Chapter\r\n__Creative Director & Steering Committee Organizer  - 2009 – 2010__  \r\nWorking with this young, energetic and ambitious group of activists was a very rewarding and stimulating experience. I came onboard as the chapter was being revived after several years of dormancy. I primarily focused on forming and empowering the group's online efforts, at this stage that consisted of newsletters, informational sites and \"Write Your Representative\" campaigns. Of the 6 core issues, our biggest success came from on-the-ground voter registration and campaigning for progressive canidates in Southern & Central California representative races.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Foresight Science & Technology, Providence, RI\r\n__In-House Interactive, Graphic & Identity Designer 2007-2008__  \r\nAs the lead designer for Foresight, a Tech Transfer firm, I was responsible for a complete redesign of the corporate identity, including logo and branding, print collateral and implementation across a broad range of electronic and presentational media.I designed and developed an entirely new public-facing website, intranet and a \"Product Selector\" web app. Finally, I worked alongside the founder & CEO to develop T2+2, a Service-as-a-Product package of Commercialization Assistance geared toward individuals and inventors, rather than the typical corporate, government and military clients. \r\n\r\n"}
