### Experience

####Ely Kahn Creative Design (Independent), San Francisco, CA
    
__Web & Graphic Designer - 2010 to Present__  
As an Indie Web Designer in San Francisco, there are an unfathomable number of opportunities paired with an equally inconceivable number of skilled competitors. My broad skill-set allows me to take on and execute comprehensive campaigns that involve branding & identity, graphic design, web design and development and tie it all together as a holistic User Experience and Social Media strategy

####Progressive Democrats of America, East Bay Chapter
__Creative Director & Steering Committee Organizer  - 2009 – 2010__  
Working with this young, energetic and ambitious group of activists was a very rewarding and stimulating experience. I came onboard as the chapter was being revived after several years of dormancy. I primarily focused on forming and empowering the group's online efforts, at this stage that consisted of newsletters, informational sites and "Write Your Representative" campaigns. Of the 6 core issues, our biggest success came from on-the-ground voter registration and campaigning for progressive candidates in Southern & Central California representative races.

####Foresight Science & Technology, Providence, RI
__In-House Interactive, Graphic & Identity Designer 2007-2008__  
As the lead designer for Foresight, a Tech Transfer firm, I was responsible for a complete redesign of the corporate identity, including logo and branding, print collateral and implementation across a broad range of electronic and presentational media.I designed and developed an entirely new public-facing website, intranet and a "Product Selector" web app. Finally, I worked alongside the founder & CEO to develop T2+2, a Service-as-a-Product package of Commercialization Assistance geared toward individuals and inventors, rather than the typical corporate, government and military clients.
